# StringSearch.Legacy
This project represents the legacy StringSearch library, originally built to power the Mono WebForms API.  
It forms part of the domain for the new .Net Core API, but is separated in order for there to be a distinction between the new domain library and the old code.  
This code is still used, just wrapped for dependency injection and otherwise not touched.
